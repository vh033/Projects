          <p>During this time I had started going to school, presumably could talk now and even started trumpet</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Started to play trumpet at 8 years old</li>
                <li>Must have started to play sports: soccer and teeball and perhaps tennis</li>

          <code>Take notice of my shirt, it says "What" as in "What Now". "What Now" was a kids tv show on Saturday mornings with games and other funny stuff like that. Somewhat informative for kids and somewhat just fun entertainment to keep us out of Mum and Dad's hair...</code>
          <p>My first pair of horrible glasses. I guess maybe we thought they would be temporary, but sadly....I had this pair until university</p>

          <p>Hard to remember what happened here.</p>
          <p>But, there are a few things. I moved from Westburn primary school, the uniform that you see in the previous photo to Breens Intermediate school. This was quite a big shift as the demographic was really different, the music department was much worse and generally education was lower. However it gave me a good chance to develop social skills of more "common" people, the type who would become plumbers and electricians. </p>
            <p>In fact one of my friends from this time became a plumber or electrician and did work on Mum and Dad's house.</p>

            <h3>Key Points or Memories</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Changed schools to Breens Intermediate. Tricky to leave friends, but the school was right down the street</li>
                    <li>Masturbated for the first time</li>
                    <li>Started high school</li>
                    <li>First cell-phone, literally a phone. Couldn't even text</li>
                    <li>Started playing basketball</li>
                    <li>Stopped playing basketball and joined the school orchestra</li>
                    <li>Discovered jazz, and joined jazz ensembles at school</li>
                    <li>Family trip to Europe: first time overseas to somewhere other than Australia</li>

      <code>I think this photo is roughly at this time, around 12 years old, at least it's the right room that I would have practiced in. I use to love the animal curtains in the background, at a time like right now when I can't sleep, I used to just look at all the shapes of them.
        <br>
        <br>
        You can also see the basketball shoes in the foreground, left. And the viola shoulder rest I'm using is the same one I'm using now!
